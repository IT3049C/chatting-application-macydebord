This lab was very doable for me as I do have some experience with Bootstrap, HTML, etc.

### How long it took me to finish this?
About an hour.

## Discussion Questions:
1. What does the bootstrap `display-4` class do?
The display-4 class applies larger font sizes for headings while keeping a lighter weight still.
